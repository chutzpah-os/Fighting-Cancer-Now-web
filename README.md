Fighting Cancer Now is an open-source global initiative aimed at centralizing cancer-related data from around the world and providing a platform for collective fundraising. The project seeks to empower patients, hospitals, researchers, and projects by offering transparent access to health data and enabling targeted support through donations.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a unified, global, and transparent system that connects individuals, organizations, and researchers in the fight against cancer. By combining open data and collective action, we aim to accelerate progress in treatment, support, and research.

## Key Features

- **Global Cancer Data Hub**: Centralization of real-world cancer statistics from reliable sources (WHO, CDC, INCA, etc.).
- **Fundraising Platform**: Donation campaigns for individuals, hospitals, oncology projects, and scientific research.
- **Transparency**: Clear reporting of where funds are directed.
- **Open Collaboration**: Contributions from developers, researchers, and volunteers worldwide.
